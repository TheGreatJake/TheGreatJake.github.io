<h2>Summary Of Story</h2>
<p>There was a plane crash at a deserted island, the kids who survived teamed up to survive on the island. Ralph took the leader position of the group, Ralph decided to always have a signal fire going, incase someone were to rescue them, and to also build shelters incase of a storm. Piggy another important character agrees with Ralph, Jack however only cares about hunting, and getting meat. Ralph and Piggy find a conch, from then on the use the conch as a horn to signal for a meeting. Ralph, Simon, and Jack decide to explore, they find a mountain and think it would be great for a signal fire. Ralph and Simon continue building shelters, but Jack continues hunting. They create signal fires using Piggy's glasses, everyone except for Jack and his hunters are on the beach building shelters, and finding food. Jack and his hunters were supposed to be keeping the fire alive but get distracted by a pig running by, they do hunt the pig and get food, but the fire dies as this happens, and when the fire was out, a ship passed by but did not stop.<br /><br /> Later on that night a pilot from a war going on somewhere else, crashes in the forest. Sam and Eric spot the body when collecting firewood, they quickly run to tell everyone about it, they believe the pilot was a beast. Jack and the hunters go to hunt for the beast, everyone else leaves with him because Piggy is watching the littuns at the beach. Ralph figures out that Jack hates him for not hunting. They see the so called beast, and run back, later on Jack decides to kick Ralph out of the leader position, not enough people agree so then Jack runs away by himself, to create his own tribe. Some people join Jack in his tribe, they become the hunters, Jack wishes to build a fort on Castle Rock (A huge rocky pillar)  and hunt pigs. They do kill a pig and invite everyone but Ralph and Piggy to the feast, they also plant the pigs head on a stick, that they leave in the woods. Simon wanders off into the woods, he mistakened the pig head for the "Lord Of The Flies" because of the flies swarming the head. He hallucinates after seeing it, he believed he was taking to it until he lost consciousness, when he woke up he saw the pilot and realized it was not the beast.<br /><br /> Ralph and Piggy go over and talk to Jack about how they need to have a meeting, Ralph and Piggy spot a storm coming and warn everyone. When they are doing this Simon comes over, he tries to tell everyone about how the pilot's body isn't a beast, all the boys just beat him mercilessly unaware of who it is. The remaining people on Ralph's side (Ralph, Piggy, Sam, and Eric), decide to go to Castle Rock, and talk to Jack. When they are climbing up, Roger decides to roll a rock off the edge, hitting Piggy off and sending him straight to death, also destroying the conch. Sam and Eric are taken as prisoners, and Jack decides to hunt Ralph! Ralph runs away and hides, they decide to make him escape by burning the whole jungle. This creates a huge fire, and Ralph is running for his life, Ralph makes it to the beach and collapses to the ground. He does this right in front of a naval officer, who saw the smoke from the island.<br /><br /></p>

<h2>Character Descriptions</h2>
  <h4>Ralph</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Leader</li>
    <li>Confident</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Ralph takes the leader position in the group, he was elected because he has confidence in himself, and will shut someone down, to make himself seem better.</p>
  
  <h4>Piggy</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Smart</li>
    <li>Unathletic</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Piggy is picked for being the chubby one in the group, he is constantly made fun of, and physically hurt from Jack/Ralph. He is the brain of the group, meaning he is a lot smarter than anyone, he cannot help out with physical labour, because he has asthma.</p>

  <h4>Jack</h4> 
  <ul>
    <li>Aggressive</li>
    <li>Hunter</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Jack is very aggressive in the group physically hurting people if they do not obey him, or listen to his ideas, he is more focused on hunting then doing other great things. For example: Building a shelter, creating a signal to show rescuers, etc, the only thing that matters to him, is hunting animals and collecting the meat.</p>

  <h4>Sam/Eric</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Playful</li>
    <li>Loyal</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The two twins aren’t too productive, they mainly have fun with each other, and adventure with each other. Their only job is to keep the signal fire going.</p>

  <h4>Simon</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Independant</li>
    <li>Introvert/Antisocial</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Simon doesn’t really talk much in the group, he likes to go explore the jungle at night when everyone is asleep. He was once spotted by a littleun and was mistaken for a beast, to stop any fear from starting, he admitted it was him, but this started suspicion towards him.</p>
  
  <h4>Roger</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Secretive</li>
    <li>Untrustworthy</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Not much has been said about Roger, he doesn’t really talk to much or agree on things. He also isn’t very productive.</p>

  <h4>Littleuns</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Playful</li>
    <li>Terrified</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The littleuns are not very productive for the group, they play on the sand, and eat fruit. This just lowers food amounts, and production of necessary things. They also exaggerate things they see to sound scary, as they don’t really know what it is. This can make everyone scared of the island, and slow down production.</p>

  <h4>Maurice</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Aggressive</li>
    <li>Not friendly</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Not much has been said about Maurice, he is a bigun that picks on the littleuns when bored, he also helps out Jack with hunting.</p>

  <h4>Robert</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Aggressive</li>
    <li>Unconfident</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Again not much is said about Robert, he is so far pretty similar to Maurice, who helps out Jack, and also picks on the littleuns.</p>

  <h4>Percival</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Scared</li>
    <li>Overdramatic</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Percival is a littleun, he believed that a monster/beast, came out to attack through the water. He is normally nervous, and picked on by the littuns.</p>

  <h4>Johnny</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Weak</li>
    <li>Unfriendly</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Johnny is a littleun, he has a reputation of being a mean kid, he likes to pick on other littleuns.</p>

  <h4>Henry</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Big</li>
    <li>Harmless</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Henry is the biggest out of all the littleuns, each littleun wasn’t described to well, this means there isn’t too much info about Henry. He is still picked on by biguns, but not as much as other, because he is bigger than them all, meaning he might be stronger.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion On Why I Made This Website</h2>
  <p>I decided to make this website because it was fun! Also because I wanted to try something different, I have also always wanted to try coding, because it seemed really cool that I could type in code words,  which would output something with a crazy affect. The challenges I have faced with this project: I had to <strong>teach myself</strong>(I did that with HTML) how to code using, HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheet). I did this by using other websites that taught me code. I also had to do this in a certain time period. Overall this was very fun and definitely worth my time which took around 30mins- 1 hour per day, and would like to continue it longer.</p>
